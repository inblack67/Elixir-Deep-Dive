## Elixir

### Atoms

- Constants
- References to atom table, thus space efficient
- Boolean values => true , false and nil are also atoms

### Aliases

```sh
alias IO, as: myio
```

- **Atoms** **nil** and **false** are falsy rest are truthy
- **Tuples** are of fixed length
- **Lists** are of dynamic length and they actually are **Singly Linked Lists**
